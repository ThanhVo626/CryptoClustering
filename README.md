# CryptoClustering

This challenge was fairly simple and straightforward. The process is very linear so most of the things we did in class translated almost one to one with the assignment.
The only problem I had was finding the difference between the original clustering and the PCA data using the elbow test.
It felt like both showed a n_cluster of four however I knew I was wrong and wasn't fully sure why.
